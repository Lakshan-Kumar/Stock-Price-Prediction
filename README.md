# Stock Price Prediction using Support Vector Regression (SVR)

This project implements a **Stock Price Prediction** model using **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**. The dataset contains stock prices, and the model is trained to predict future prices based on historical data.

## Features:
- Uses **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** for stock price forecasting.
- Implements **data preprocessing**, **train-test split**, and **model evaluation**.
- Evaluates performance using **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** and **R² Score**.
- Simple and easy-to-follow implementation.

## Installation and Usage:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Lakshan-Kumar/Stock-Price-Prediction.git
   cd Stock-Price-Prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `stock_price_prediction_svm.ipynb` and execute the cells.

## Model Performance:
The model is evaluated using **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** and **R² Score** to measure prediction accuracy.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn (Support Vector Regression)
